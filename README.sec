[Done] We are moving /splitting our work [HashToken, RandomToken, etc.]
  out of django/utils/crypto.py into django/utils/tokens.py

[   ] We also need to have the funtionality of contrib/auth/tokens.py in django/utils/tokens.py (eventually, we can move this out of contrib...)

[   ] Do we need to do anything with django/utils/hashcompat.py ?  (e.g. change the warning message to ref. tokens.py?)

[   ] I assume we want to leave django/utils/crypto alone, not using new django/utils/token - Paul: can you confirm?

[   ]  django/contrib/auth/utils.py will need some lovin' eyes, will need to be looked over.  Do we want to leave it?  Modify it (how)?
